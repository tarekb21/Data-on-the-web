The "Data on the Web" course provided a comprehensive exploration of various topics related to managing and utilizing data on the internet. Throughout the course, students engaged in hands-on projects covering a range of essential concepts. These included the development of conceptual models for data representation, working with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, constructing JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and defining JSON schemas for structured data, as well as exploring RDF (Resource Description Framework) and RDFS (RDF Schema) for semantic data representation. The diverse set of projects equipped participants with practical skills in data modeling, interchange formats, and semantic web technologies, fostering a holistic understanding of data management in the web environment.
